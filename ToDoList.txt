# Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model: package vars

1. Set up a toy dynamic VAR model over a sliding window.

2. Study the effect of adding an extra ts to the VAR model.  
Add extra ts consisting of random returns.
Add two extra ts consisting of the same determenistic trend plus/minus random returns that exactly offset each other.
Does adding the second ts improve forecasts?  
Do the forecasts deteriorate?

3. Apply ensemble technique, run many models with: 
a.) different sliding window parameters,
b.) select the model with highest lagging forecasting power,


#####
Custom Vector Auto Regression model:
1. Perform dynamic regression
a.) identify variables with high statistical significance, and drop variables with low significance,
b.) perform forecasting only if regression has significant forecasting power, otherwise set forecast to zero,

2. Calculate a running Discounted Mean Squared Error (DMSE) or Out-of-sample R2 of model prediction errors
a.) Is the DMSE itself predictable?  (Does it move like sine wave?)
b.) Is the DMSE correlated to the p-values of model calibration?
Is the quality of the model fit related to the prediction errors?

3. Perform a custom forecastable components analysis (FCA)
a.) Find the first FC: maximize scores for var.ratio or spec.frac (under shrinkage constraints),
b.) Apply parameter shrinkage similar to ridge, LASSO or Elasticnet,
c.) Find the second FC: statistically independent from first FC (Matteson),
d.) Forecast each component separately (since they are statistically independent),


4. Apply R packages: LARS, lasso, lasso2, mda, Elasticnet, glmnet, grpreg, penalized, 
a.) 
b.) 



#####
ForeCA Analysis
1. Compare Omega scores with different smoothing and spectrum_method parameters: direct (default), wosa, multitaper.

2. Calculate Omega scores in a sliding window, to see how much they change.

3. What are the Omega score confidence intervals and p-values?

4. Find maximum Omega score portfolios, in non-overlapping time periods.  
How much do the weights change over time?  
Are maximum Omega score portfolios stable over time?
Create a maximum Omega score portfolio, and observe if it's still close to maximum in next time period.  
What's the turnover of assets?

5. Look at spectral density of different signals.  
Compare scatterplots of Omega scores versus simple spectral density.

6. Apply DEoptim to maximize spectral density.

7. Calculate running alphas in a sliding window.
How stable are they?  Are alphas more forecastable than the original asset returns themselves?


#####
Combine weighted average time series of stock, CDS, bond and Treasury to create the highest:
	a.) VarRatio
	b.) convexity (scatterplot)



#####

Create LBO screen
Ask Glenn to get LBO lists from dealers
Ask Seth or Chase for symbols of liquid or benchmark bonds
Ask Seth for index option parsing
Ask Victor to add Spanish stock futures

#####

Compile var.ratios, specEnergyFrac, and omega scores for all symbols
Combine symbols with sectors, industries and geographies

How does specEnergyFrac change over sliding window (per name, per sector)?

How stable are names with highest specEnergyFrac over sliding window (name turnover)?

Repeat the above analysis using VarRatio

#####

PCA Portfolio CDS Strategies

1. Combine PC loadings with symbols and sectors, industries and geographies
	a.) Identify sector portfolios

2. Build PC's out of long-short sector portfolios, instead of individual CDS

3. Repeat PCA using the market portfolio and sector portfolios

4. Run PCA with all CDS, using multi-day percentage returns
	a.) Take the first 10 PC's,
	b.) For each PC take the top 20 CDS,
	c.) Combine all the top CDS, and perform cluster analysis,
	d.) Identify highly correlated portfolios of CDS,
	e.) Repeat the PCA using the portfolios,

#####

Build an IG index model using principal components as exogenous variables.  Use several different models:

1. Rank-order the individual CDS according to joint score of trending and correlation with IG index.
	a.) Calculate PCA using only top-ranked CDS
	b.) Repeat using percentage aggregated returns over multiday periods
	c.) doesn't work well


2. ARIMAX (transfer function) model: package TSA, diff the prices.

3. VAR model: package vars
	a.) First forecast prices, then diff them to forecast returns,
	b.) Run rolling VAR model over sliding training window,
	c.) Study PnL as function of window size,
	d.) Create two trading strategies: trend-following and mean-reverting,
	e.) The trend-following strategy is daily,
	f.) The mean-reverting strategy is intra-day,

4. Dynamic regression model using Kalman filter: package dlm
	a.) Run dlmFilter over expanding apply window and compare with single-call dlmFilter
	b.) Run dlmFilter using array of different variance parameters for observation and system noise
	c.) Run dlmFilter over expanding apply window and update variance parameters from sd and lm calls
start with smaller C0, the variance matrix of the pre-sample state vector.
	d.) Create two ts proportional to each other, with jumps in beta.  Apply Dynamic Regression Model using Kalman filter to estimate the beta, and observe dependence on variance parameters.

Apply the IG index model to a sine function plus ARIMA process

4.

Kalman filter

Create intra-day IG index model using Kalman filter

Create Kalman filter model for forecasting returns one-step-ahead: this works best

use difference between current price and forecast price: doesn't work as well

Use difference between current price and filtered price: works, but over-trades
	tune Kalman filter parameters to reduce over-trading

apply Kalman filter to log prices and to log returns: doesn't work better

Create Kalman filter model for beta: doesn't work - tries to converge to fixed value

Screen names for recent trending

create PCA for recent trending names

create screen for European and sovereign names

create model using level regression residuals between PCA and index
	instead estimate beta using Kalman filter


#####


CDS momentum strategy

1. Rank-order the individual CDS according to Kalman filtered percentage aggregated returns.
	a.) Calculate PCA using only top-ranked CDS
	b.) Repeat using percentage aggregated returns over multiday periods
